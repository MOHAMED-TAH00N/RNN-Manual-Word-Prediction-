# RNN-Manual-Word-Prediction-
This project builds a simple Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) using pure Python. It predicts the fourth word in a 4-word sentence using the first three. The implementation includes forward pass, cross-entropy loss, backpropagation through time (BPTT), and gradient descent. Itâ€™s ideal for learning RNNs at a low level.
